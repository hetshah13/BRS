**BRS: BOOK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM**

This Project Book Recommendation System is developed using Streamlit, and it contains User-Based Collaborative Filtering & Top Rating of Books.

In Top Rating of Books, we have selected the top 50 books based on Rating score. Whichever books have the highest score, we have sorted them by their Rating.

In User-Based Collaborative Filtering, we predict the books that a user might like based on ratings given to that book by other users who have a similar 
taste to that of the target user.
