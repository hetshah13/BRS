# BRS: BOOK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

This Project Book Recommendation System is developed using **_Streamlit_**, and it contains User-Based Collaborative Filtering & Top Rating of Books. [Checkout WebSite](https://brsbookrecommendation.streamlit.app/)

In **_Top Rating of Books_**, we have selected the top 50 books based on Rating score. Whichever books have the highest score, we have sorted them by their Rating.

In **_User-Based Collaborative Filtering_**, we predict the books that a user might like based on ratings given to that book by other users who have a similar 
taste to that of the target user.


This Repository only have pickle files and a Streamlit app.py.
